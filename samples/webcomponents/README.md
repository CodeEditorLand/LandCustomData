# Web Component Custom Data Sample

This sample demonstrates how you can use VS Code's
[HTML / CSS Custom Data](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-custom-data)
support to enhance your WebComponents HTML editing experience.

The Custom Data format enhances auto-completion and hover information support
for HTML. These two features ease the two essential acts of coding: reading and
writing code. With its Markdown support, Custom Data allows you to show text
documentation, links and code samples, right in the editor when the user is
writing or reading the WebComponents HTML.

You can join the
[discussion at w3c/webcomponents](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/776),
or open new issues in this repository to discuss about Custom Data.

## Demo

## Explanation

When you open this folder in VS Code, you should be able to use the
auto-completion and hover features as shown in the demo above. You can try these
features in [index.html](./index.html).

This is supported through the `html.customData` setting found in
[`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json):

```json
{
	"html.customData": [
		"./src/web-components.html-data.json",
		"./node_modules/@github/time-elements/web-components.html-data.json"
	]
}
```

The setting points to a list of JSON files that follows the
[HTML Custom Data schema](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice/blob/master/docs/customData.schema.json).
VS Code's HTML Language Server will read those JSON during startup and then
provide language editing features for the defined HTML tags, attributes and
attribute values.

The two demos show two different scenarios:

1. [`src/web-components.html-data.json`](./src/web-components.html-data.json).
   This shows how users who have written components and wish to use them in HTML
   can take advantage of Custom Data.

    The JSON file `src/web-component.html-data.json` can either be hand-written
    or generated by tools such as
    https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer.

2. [`node_modules/@github/time-elements/web-components.html-data.json`](node_modules/@github/time-elements/web-components.html-data.json).
   This shows how WebComponents library authors can distribute Custom Data with
   their components to offer documentation, auto completion and hover
   information to end users. This is similar to how today JavaScript library
   authors distribute their packages with
   [TypeScript type definitions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).
   (For example, look at `node_modules/@github/time-elements/index.d.ts`).

    The Custom Data for
    [@github/time-elements](https://github.com/github/time-elements) currently
    is hand-written, but in the future it might be possible to:

-   Use an analyzer to examine the JS entry file and generate such Custom Data
-   Let frameworks emit such Custom Data as part of their compilation process
    (just as TypeScript would generate `d.ts` files from TS files)

## Limitations

-   [ ] VS Code's HTML language server loads these components upon startup.
        Ideally, as users change the configuration, VS Code's HTML language
        server should reload the data.
        https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/67750.
-   [ ] `slot` is not being parsed and no `<slot>` or `<slot name="">`
        completions yet.
-   [ ] No emmet support yet. Tracked in
        https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64032.
-   [ ] There's no description for events yet.
